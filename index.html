          <h4>St. Francis and the first crib</h4>

<p>St. Francis of Assisi wanted to follow the gospel and retrace the footsteps of Jesus in all things. In the year 1223, he decided to celebrate Christmas with the people of Greccio, He gathered his friends together and asked them to 'make ready the things I tell you - for I wish to enact the memory of the Babe of Bethlehem and see with my own eyes the discomfort of his infant needs - how he lay in a manger, and how, with an ox and ass standing by - he rested on hay'.</p>

<p>When the special night arrived, the men, women and children from the village came with joy in their hearts. They carried torches that lit up the night sky and when St. Francis arrived at the cave in the hillside, everything was ready.  The Manger was prepared, the hay brought in and an ox and ass were led inside near the manger.  </p>

<p>During the Mass which followed, a child was placed in the manger.  Then the brothers and people from the village sang and praised God as they celebrated the birthday of the infant Jesus and the night sky was lit up like day.  On that Christmas night in 1223 in the village of Greccio, through the inspiration of St. Francis of Assisi, a new Bethlehem was formed where simplicity is honoured and poverty exalted. (Thomas of Celano)</p>

<p>As we celebrate this Holy Season,</p>
<p>I wish to express my deep gratitude to you and all who help with our work for people in need. May the Child of Bethlehem fill your heart and home with his peace and joy this Christmas and throughout the coming year.</p>

        <h2>Welcome to Those in Need</h2>
        <p>While the Capuchin Day Centre has journeyed with people in need since 1969 including the last recession of the 1980â€™s, nothing has prepared us for the level of demand for the service.  Since the collapse of the Banks in 2008 our numbers have more than doubled.  Latest figures show we provide 250 breakfasts each day with 400 extra on a Wednesday.  Our dinner service has increased and is seldom less that 480 with a couple of days in the week exceeding 500.  In keeping with our child protection policies, we have a designated family area where parents and their children can enjoy nutritious meals in safety.  The increase in child poverty is very evident here in the Day Centre with more parents needing to avail of the service.   We also have a medical service, chiropody clinics, an optical service and advice and information clinics.  We prioritise the needs of rough sleepers and the increased energy and water charges for the shower facilities together with the provision of new underwear, personal hygiene products etc. has all added to our expenses.</p>
		<p>Despite trying to cope with the above, the greatest challenge both physically and financially is to help the increased number of people who need Food Parcels.  Demand has risen with each new phase of unemployment and rose from about 3/400 a week in 2008 to around 1,000 in 2011 with further spikes to the current level of 1800 people who need help to feed their families in the current recession.  We have not received an increase in our government funding since 2007 so we need your help more than ever.</p>
