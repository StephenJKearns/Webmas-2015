		  		<p>Christmas can be a hard time for people who do not have sufficient resources for their families and we want to help people who are struggling to make ends meet. Apart from the normal meal services, and Gala Christmas Dinner for people who attend the Centre, going on current demand, we will need to provide 3,000 Special Food Hampers.  This will cost a lot of money so we will need your help more than ever.  Our Carol Singing Street collection is our main source of funding for extra Christmas expenses, so as in the past, we know you will be generous in coming to our aid.</p>

		  <p>Support our Carol Singing Street Collection at the GPO in O’Connell Street on Saturday 6th December.   Many thanks to the “Choirs of Angels” all the voluntary collectors and the organising team who every year, brave the weather to collect funds to help cover our extra expenses over the Christmas.  If you miss us on the day you can donate to the Carol Singing. </p>

          <h2>Special thanks to our voluntary fundraisers – without your help we could not continue!</h2>
          <p>As we do not hire professional fundraisers we are most grateful to our faithful benefactors who undertake fundraising events on our behalf.  We are particularly grateful to those who organised and undertook events like the very productive Belmullet Cycle, Golf Days, Bridge Nights, Paddy Pender  & Joan McNevin’s Annual Walk, the Women’s Marathon in June and the Dublin City Marathon in October, Sponsored Fasts,  various school events, Margaret Wogan’s  Sale of Work and Christmas Concert, Drama Productions by the Gardai from the Bridewell, and the very successful Carol Singing Street Collection.  People undertook amazing challenges like mountain climbing, parachute jumps etc.  All this is apart from individual efforts of people who organised table quiz’ Schools, Clubs and Church groups organising raffles Cake Sales and food drives etc. and special charity collections.   All money raised through fundraising goes direct to frontline services.  Sincere thanks and prayers for God’s Blessings to all. </p>
